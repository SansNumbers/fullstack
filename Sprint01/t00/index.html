            <p>Ionia has always been a land of wild magic, its vibrant people and powerful spirits seeking to live in harmony... but sometimes this peaceful equilibrium does not come easily. Sometimes it needs to be kept in check. <br> The Kinkou are the self-appointed keepers of Ionias sacred balance. The orders loyal acolytes walk the spirit and material realms, mediating conflicts between them and, when necessary, intervening by force. Born among their ranks was Akali, daughter of Mayym Jhomen Tethi, the renowned Fist of Shadow. Mayym and her partner Tahno raised their daughter within the Kinkou Order, under the watchful leadership of Great Master Kusho, the Eye of Twilight. <br> Whenever her parents were called away, other members of the order stepped in as Akalis surrogate family. Kennen, the Heart of the Tempest, spent many hours with the young girl, teaching her shuriken techniques, and emphasizing speed and agility over strength. Akali was a precocious child, and soaked up the knowledge like a sponge. It became clear to all that she would follow her parents path along with the Great Masters son and appointed successor Shen, she would lead a new generation dedicated to preserving Ionias balance. But balance can be fleeting. The order found itself divided. <br> A wayward acolyte named Zed returned, and clashed violently with Kusho, wresting power in a bloody coup. Akali fled into the eastern mountains along with Mayym, Shen, Kennen, and a handful of other acolytes. Sadly, Tahno was not among them. <br> Zeds transformation of the Kinkou into the merciless Order of Shadow was almost complete. But, as the new Eye of Twilight, Shen intended to rebuild what had been lost. They would return to the Kinkous three fundamental philosophies: the pure impartiality of Watching the Stars, the passage of judgment in Coursing the Sun, and the elimination of imbalance by Pruning the Tree. Even though they were now few, they would train neophytes to restore and grow their numbers once more.
